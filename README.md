# Playwright Project

This repository contains a minimal Playwright project.

Files included:

- `verifysetup.js` — existing verification script
- `.gitignore` — ignores node modules and Playwright artifacts
- `package.json` — dev dependency for `@playwright/test`

To run verification locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run verify
```

To run Playwright tests (if you add them):

```bash
npm test
```
